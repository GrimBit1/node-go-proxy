# Node.js to Go Migration Plan

## Overview

We are migrating from Node.js to Go due to performance issues caused by CPU-intensive tasks. Our AWS Lightsail resources often overflow, and we currently use Node.js child processes to handle expensive computations. Moving to Go will provide better concurrency, lower resource usage, and improved scalability.

## Why Migrate to Go?

### Benefits:

âœ… **Better CPU Utilization** â€“ Goroutines handle concurrency more efficiently than Node.js child processes.  
âœ… **Lower Overhead** â€“ Go uses fewer system resources while processing high-load requests.  
âœ… **Predictable Performance** â€“ No event loop blocking, reducing unpredictable slowdowns.  
âœ… **Easier Scaling** â€“ Goâ€™s lightweight threading model makes high-load scaling more efficient.  
âœ… **Improved Stability** â€“ Static typing and compiled execution help catch errors early.

## Migration Strategy

### 1. **Gradual Route-Level Migration**

- We will **reverse proxy requests** from Node.js to Go for specific routes using Nginx.
- Handlers will be ported first; once an entire route group is migrated, the middleware will be moved.
- Session and authentication handling will be aligned between Node.js and Go.

### 2. **Prioritizing CPU-Intensive Tasks**

- Identify and port the most CPU-heavy processes first.
- Replace Node.js child processes with optimized Go services.
- Benchmark performance improvements before full migration.

### 3. **Performance & Resource Optimization**

- Monitor AWS Lightsail resource usage before and after migration.
- Consider moving to an autoscaling solution (e.g., AWS Fargate, ECS, or EC2) if necessary.
- Optimize Go services for better memory and CPU efficiency.

### 4. **Testing & Rollout Plan**

- A/B test Go services with production traffic before full cutover.
- Implement logging, tracing, and monitoring to catch potential issues early.
- Train the team on Go best practices for smoother adoption.

## Next Steps

- Identify key routes and services to migrate first.
- Set up the Go development environment and standardize best practices.
- Begin porting CPU-intensive tasks while maintaining full functionality in production.
- Gradually shift traffic and deprecate old Node.js services once stable.
