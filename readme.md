Your strategy sounds robust and pragmatic. Here are a few thoughts:

### Benefits

- **Gradual Migration:** By porting handler functions first and then the middleware, you can transition without a complete system rewrite. This minimizes downtime and allows you to validate functionality incrementally.
- **Flexibility:** The reverse proxy approach (using Nginx) gives you flexibility. You can route requests based on readiness, making it easier to manage mixed environments.
- **Reduced Risk:** Migrating on a per-route basis helps isolate potential issues. If a specific route or module encounters issues, you can quickly revert or fix that segment without affecting the entire application.

### Considerations

- **Session & State Management:** Make sure that shared states like authentication tokens or user sessions are properly handled between Node.js and Go. It might be necessary to centralize session management or use a shared cache/database.
- **Performance Overhead:** While reverse proxying is efficient, keep an eye on any added latency. Monitor performance as you gradually increase the migration.
- **Testing and Monitoring:** Thorough testing is crucial—both at the unit and integration levels—to ensure that your reverse proxy correctly handles all edge cases (e.g., streaming, error states). Implement robust monitoring to catch issues early.
- **Middleware Compatibility:** When you finally switch the middleware, ensure that behaviors such as logging, error handling, and security (e.g., rate limiting, CORS) are fully aligned across both implementations.

Overall, this route-level migration is a thoughtful way to reduce risk and manage changes incrementally. Just be mindful of shared dependencies and potential integration challenges as you migrate further.
